## Description

- ``` /assets``` : This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it. This directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript.

- ``` /components``` : This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it. The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

- ``` /layouts``` : This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it. This directory contains your Application Layouts.

- ``` /middleware``` : This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it. This directory contains your application middleware. Middleware let you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages.

- ``` /pages``` : This directory contains your Application Views and Routes. The framework reads all the *.vue files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

- ``` /static``` : This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it. This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to /. Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.

  Example: ```/static/robots.txt``` is mapped as ```/robots.txt```.

- ``` /store``` : This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it. This directory contains your Vuex Store files. Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates the option in the framework.
